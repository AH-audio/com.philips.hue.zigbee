This app supports setting up your Philips Hue lights to your Homey without having a Philips Hue bridge.

Currently Supported bulbs:
* LWB010 - Hue White (8718696449578)
* LTW012 - Hue White ambiance (8718696695203)

More bulbs will be added in the future.

NOTE: If the bulbs have been used with a bridge prior to connecting them directly to Homey. You will need to reset the bulb with the Philips Hue bridge before being able to add them.

Shout out to:
Robin Overgaard for lending me bulbs for further development.
