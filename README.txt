This app supports setting up your Philips Hue devices to your Homey without having a Philips Hue bridge.

Missing a Philips Hue device?
Here is a short guide when you want to request a new device to be added.

1. Add the device to Homey as a Generic Zigbee device
2. Interview the device using https://developer.athom.com/tools/zigbee
3. Wait for the interview to finish (might take a while) and post the data (press copy icon) in an issue (see below) 
4. Link to the device on www.meethue.com

Make requests by adding it as an issue on GitHub https://github.com/JohanBendz/com.philips.hue.zigbee/issues.

How to transfer a light from hue bridge to Homey (by Jesper P):
Hue lights are also resettable with the round Hue remote (i.e. Living colors gen 2 Remote).
Delete the specific light in the official iOS Hue app.
Then turn on the power of the specific light.
Then press the on button and the one dot button on the remote simultaneously, while holding the remote near the light.
The light will blink and has been reset. You can now add the light to Homey.

NOTE:
If the bulbs have been used with a bridge, or bought as a package with bridge, prior to connecting them directly to Homey.
You will need to reset the bulb with the Philips Hue bridge before being able to add them.
You can also reset the bulb with a Philips Hue Remote (8718696743157).
